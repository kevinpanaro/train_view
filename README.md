*live update notifications send to you phone, run on a raspberry pi*

notifications are handled by [pushover](https://pushover.net/) which costs 5$ for 7500 notifications per month. (240-250 a day). You could probably set up twitter DMs, for free, or use pushbullet, but I liked pushover because it's pretty instant and reliable.

Home Assistant actually runs the script, as an automation, however there are plenty of ways to run a script on a raspberry pi. I just use HA so I decided it would be easier for me to do it that way.
